        I started playing with computers when I was 5 years-old exploring the internet. 
        Since then I have been tinkering with all sorts of technologies 
        that in some way or another. Through been a geek I become passionate in building thing whether or not for hobbies or 
        for a profession. I grab building computer, keyboards, and other some projects as hobby through the internet and spend much my time on the internet. When I'm not 
        on the internet im learn more on coding through books and pick up more skills.

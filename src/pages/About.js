        <h1>I recently graduated from Rutgers University after completing Bachelor of Science in computer Science .

            As a web developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design â€” combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

            When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably reading books, travelling or playing video games.
